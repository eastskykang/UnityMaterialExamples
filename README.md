# UnityMaterialExamples

1. Clone this repository with git and [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/): we use git-lfs for large files such as materials, meshes, texture images etc.
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/eastskykang/RaiSimUnity.git
    ```
2. Once you cloned source code, get lfs files by 
    ```sh
    $ git lfs pull origin
    ```
    You should see texture JPEG files properly from ```Assets/Resources/texture/cc0/```.
